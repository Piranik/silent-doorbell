Constantly looking out the window so that you can intercept visitors before they ring the doorbell? Tired of the dogs and baby going crazy anytime it rings? Don't want to spend a fortune on a "smart" solution? 

Making a silent doorbell is as easy as hacking a $5 Amazon Dash Button! The only other thing you need is a computer that's always at home - like, say, that Raspberry Pi you've got sitting around. Get text notifications anytime someone pushes your new door bell and keep the whole house happy. (It's even cooler to get notifications if you have a smartwatch!)
